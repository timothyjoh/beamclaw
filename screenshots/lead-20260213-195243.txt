  Meanwhile, the Architect is actively revising. I'll wait for their updated doc, then move to
  Task #4 synthesis myself, weaving in the Devil's Advocate's analysis from the .md file plus my
  own observations from the team discussions.


@devils-advocate❯ Analysis complete - critical issues identified with solutions

⏺ Good — the Devil's Advocate finally delivered. Let me read the CRITIQUE.md and check if the
  Architect's revision is done yet.

⏺ Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The CRITIQUE.md is excellent — 704 lines of thorough, concrete analysis. This is exactly what I
  needed. The Devil's Advocate ultimately delivered strong work. Now I have all the ingredients
  for the final synthesis:

  - Researcher: Complete subsystem analysis (Gateway, Sessions, Agents, Tools, Cron, Channels,
  Providers)
  - Architect: Draft architecture with Phoenix Gateway design, supervision trees, GenServer
  patterns, behaviours
  - Devil's Advocate: 11-point critique with specific issues, solutions, ecosystem gaps, and BEAM
  wins

  The Architect is still revising. Let me send the Devil's Advocate's critique directly to them
  and prepare to take over Task #4.

⏺ Now let me mark the Devil's Advocate task as complete and prepare for synthesis.

⏺ Good. Tasks #1 and #3 complete. Waiting on #2 (Architect's final revision), then I take over #4.
   All the raw material is ready — I can start drafting the synthesis in my head while the
  Architect finishes.


⏺ Good — the Devil's Advocate sent their critique directly to the Architect. Both are engaged. Now
   I wait for the Architect to finish their final revision of docs/architecture.md incorporating
  everything.

  Let me check if the Architect has updated the doc yet.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The doc was last modified about a minute ago — the Architect may still be writing. Let me give
  them a moment and then check the content. Meanwhile, I'll shut down the Devil's Advocate since
  their work is done.

⏺ Waiting for the Architect to finish their final revision, then I'll take over Task #4 to write
  the definitive docs/architecture.md.


@devils-advocate❯ Sent 5 critical issues to architect with solutions

⏺ Perfect — the Devil's Advocate delivered their critique directly to the Architect before
  shutting down. All the pieces are in place.


⏺ The Devil's Advocate is idle after sending their critique. They already approved shutdown
  conceptually but the request may need to be re-sent since they kept working. Let me wait for the
   Architect to finish — that's the bottleneck now.

⏺ The Architect is still working on their final revision (Task #2). Rather than wait idle, let me
  check if the doc has been updated recently and start preparing for my synthesis work.

⏺ Teammate @devils-advocate shut down gracefully

⏺ Doc was updated a minute ago — the Architect is actively writing. Devil's Advocate has shut
  down. Let me check if the Architect has made significant changes.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The top hasn't changed much yet. Let me check further down to see if the Session, Tool, or Cron
  sections have been revised.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ It's grown from 917 lines to 1459 lines — significant additions. The Architect is clearly
  working. Let me wait for them to signal completion rather than reading a moving target. I'll
  check back when they message me or mark Task #2 complete.

⏺ Devil's Advocate shut down. Two down, one to go. The Architect is the last active teammate —
  working on their final 1459-line revision of docs/architecture.md. Once they mark Task #2
  complete, I'll take over Task #4 for the final synthesis.

  Current team status:
  - Researcher — Shut down (Task #1 complete)
  - Devil's Advocate — Shut down (Task #3 complete)
  - Architect — Active, finishing final revision (Task #2 in progress)
  - Me — Waiting to synthesize (Task #4 pending, blocked by #2)


@architect❯ Architecture revision complete — all critical issues fixed

⏺ The Architect has finished. Let me read the full revised doc, then take over Task #4 to write
  the final synthesis.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent — the Architect's revision is comprehensive. 1571 lines, all critical issues
  addressed. Now I have everything I need. Let me shut down the Architect, take over Task #4, and
  write the final synthesized docs/architecture.md.

⏺ Now let me write the final synthesized docs/architecture.md. The Architect's revision is very
  good but needs:
  1. An executive summary
  2. OpenClaw architecture overview (from Researcher)
  3. Risks & mitigations section (from Devil's Advocate)
  4. "Where BEAM Wins" section
  5. Ecosystem gaps section
  6. Some cleanup of stale sections (7. State Persistence still has old append-per-message code)
  7. Tool approval flow (missing, flagged by Devil's Advocate)

  Let me write the definitive version.
