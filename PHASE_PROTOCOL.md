# Phase Completion Protocol

Run this checklist at the end of every phase.

## 1. Verification
- [ ] All team tasks marked complete
- [ ] Lead has verified the deliverable works (compile, run, test)

## 2. Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for new modules
- [ ] Integration test for the phase deliverable
- [ ] All tests pass (`mix test`)

## 3. Git
- [ ] `git add -A && git commit -m "Phase N: description"`
- [ ] `git push`

## 4. Reflection (ask the lead before it shuts down)
- [ ] What did we learn this phase? Any surprises?
- [ ] Any changes needed to PLAN.md for future phases?
- [ ] Any prompting/orchestration improvements for next team?
- [ ] Any architectural suggestions → update docs/architecture.md?
- [ ] Any other meta-observations?

## 5. Documentation
- [ ] Update DECISIONS.md with phase completion + key decisions
- [ ] Capture terminal screenshots for blog post
- [ ] Update memory files

## 6. Report
- [ ] Discord ping to Butter with summary
